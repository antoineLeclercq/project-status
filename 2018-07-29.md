## Closing in on v1 Release

We're in the final stretch and starting to think about a release date. Current progress says that we should be able to declare a v1 at the end of September.

## Documentation

The documentation effort continues at pace. A good deal of progress has been made, but there's still a good deal of ground to cover.

Work is focused almost exclusively at this point on the user guides, and will continue so until release.

There remain a number of readme pages needed for utility libraries.

## Implementation

The outstanding work items continue to be completed as time permits. The _must haves_ remaining are:

- Rework and improvement of Consumer
- Rework and improvement of Cycle
- Removal of implicit modification of the Object class
- Sharing of connection objects through the stack
