## Removing Barriers for Contributors

### Contributor Guide

In an effort to foster community by encouraging first-time contributors - or at least removing barriers for anyone interested in trying - we produced a contributor guide that, ideally, combined with support from project principals, will help people get started.

### Contributor Bill of Rights

Along with the contributor guide, we produced a contributor bill of rights to communicate and enshrine the expectations that contributors and stewards should have, and to reinforce the character of the Eventide community.

### Issue Labels

Leveraging the `contributor-assets` tools, we standardized every repository's issue labels to the same set of labels. We published a description of each each label in effort to clarify the mechanics of the project's contributor and project principal workflow.

### Issue and Work Item Triage

We have done a first pass over the work items in-queue, assigning labels, and prioritizing them.

We will start working through the items this week.

### ZenHub Work Board

We got an open source license for ZenHub in order to allow principals to organize work items into staged queues.

We will review the queues this week.
