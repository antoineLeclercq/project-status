We've been busy catching up on a host of improvements to a number libraries in advance of making some larger improvements to core libraries.

These libraries include:

- Attribute
- Initializer
- Reflect
- Transform
- Validate
- SubstAttr
- Dependency
- Casing
- Clock
- Cycle
- Schema
- Log
- Messaging
- MessageStore
- MessageStorePostgres
- EntityCache
- ComponentHost

In addition, we started work on a standardized interface for benchmarking for libraries in the stack. This work will be applied to upcoming improvements to the foundational data access library in the Postgres implementation.
