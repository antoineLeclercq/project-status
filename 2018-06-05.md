We just finished one of the more significant outstanding changes to the core Postgres library. By introducing advisory locks to the the message writing server function, writes to a single stream are serialized. This eliminates false-negative errors that occur when writing to a single stream concurrently, as happens when writing commands from a web controller. Previously, this was addressed with a retry. The retry is no longer necessary.

The next phase of work will see the retrieval SQL that is embedded in the client library (and making use of string interpolation) being moved to server functions. This will not only improve the performance of reads, but also the encapsulation and security of the operations.

Following this work, attention will shift exclusively to documentation. Although, this work may be interrupted by preparation of material for the GoRuCo conference.
