# Project Status - Sat Jun 9 2018

We've just completed one of the major milestones on the critical path to a v1 release:

We improved isolation of writes with Postgres advisory locks, and we moved all data retrieval code from the Ruby library to Postgres server functions.

With the data retrieval code now in the database, the database now stands on its own as a generalized message store that can be used from any platform without having to reproduce any of the specialized queries required for interaction with the message store.

There remains two development tasks that are requisites for a 1.0 release:

Remove all implicit modification of the Object class
[https://github.com/eventide-project/eventide/issues/2](https://github.com/eventide-project/eventide/issues/2)

Share session objects throughout the stack to avoid superfluous database connections
[https://github.com/eventide-project/eventide/issues/1](https://github.com/eventide-project/eventide/issues/1)

Beyond development tasks, the bigger task that remains ahead is documentation. And this task will take at least a month or two, provided that preemptions are kept to a minimum.

And of course, beyond all this, it's important to remember that Eventide has been in production since 2015, and the "v1" label is really just a formality at this point.
