# Project Status - Tue Mar 6 2018

Scott Bellware

## Background
Nathan and I are back from being on the road since December. Our plan for December had been to dedicate time to documentation, as well as some nice improvements to the toolkit that we've had on the back-burner. We're returning our focus to this work exclusively for the next month.

We got together on Sunday, March 4th and listed the work that we wanted to do.

## Items

### Documentation
- Documentation requests repository (users submit via GitHub issues)
- Readme pages for every user-facing library in the toolkit
- Recipes, patterns, procedures

### Process
- Harmonize issues labels and colors across all repositories in all organizations maintained by the Eventide project, including code, as well as materials
- Look into ZenHub as a task board (once labels are harmonized)
- Review and disposition all outstanding issues and PRs

### Implementation
- Use Postgres advisory locks when inserting a message to better serialize and isolate transactions without resorting to row or table locks, and while avoiding expected version conflicts and retries with concurrent writes to the same stream
- Move retrieval statements to Postgres server functions
- Direct tests for server functions
- Share session objects throughout the stack so as to avoid superfluous database connections. Although this has never been a problem in practice, it's sloppier than we can tolerate.
- Remove all implicit modification of the Object class by including extension modules directly in the classes that use the extensions
- Build session objects from environment variables as a workaround for the PG gem's lack of support for this later Postgres feature

### Community
- Eventide blog in Q2
- Podcast in Q2 or Q3
